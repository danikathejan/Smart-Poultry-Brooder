## Introduction
A poultry brooder serves as a chick's first home, providing essential care during the early, vulnerable stages of their life. Ensuring proper nurturing and protection is crucial for their healthy development. The Smart Poultry Brooder project was designed to create a safe, controlled environment that is continuously monitored. By integrating sensors and actuators, the system can automatically regulate key environmental parameters, ensuring optimal conditions for the chicks while providing real-time feedback to maintain consistent monitoring and adjustments.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity levels.
- Automated control actions to maintain optimal temperature and humidity.
- Measurement of water intake with automated tank refilling based on consumption.
- Monitoring and tracking of feed intake.
- Daily records of water and feed intake logged in Excel for further analysis.
